# Static_Website_Example1
First project from the early stages of learning web development.

I have been focused primarily on software development for years, but I recently decided that it would be good to know web development for my future career as well. That being said, I haven't really messed with any web languages in about 10 years, so I essentially need to start from the beginning with HTML and CSS. I've been at it for about a week and a half, and this project is the result of learning so far. It's not meant to be anything fancy, just a good, simple way to start. I also chose the subject of drums simply to act like I was making the project for a client, as I am not a musician or interested in drums.
